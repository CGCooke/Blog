    "## Raison d'être\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Buy Now, Pay Later\" (BNPL) service providers like *Afterpay* have stormed onto the scene, attracting the attention of both consumers, as well as investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm intrigued by *Afterpay*. I understand that a cohort of consumers exists, who may require the cost of a purchase to be spread over 8 weeks, in order to be able to afford it. However, I fail to see the attraction for most creditworthy customers. Unless *Afterpay* dramatically starts allowing me to buy shares, I'm not really interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just because I don't see the value, doesn't mean that other people might adopt and love the product. It's clear that millions of people both in Australia, and overseas regularly use *Afterpay*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All things being equal, I can see the consumer benefits of *Afterpay*, vs other more classical forms of consumer credit (Credit cards, payday loans etc). However, *Afterpay*'s customers don't live in a vacuum, and It's entirely possible that some cohort of their customers may be using a medley of products and services to finance their lifestyle. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, all of these things exist outside the reality of what *Afterpay* reports to the ASX, and outside of my focus. I wanted to dig deeper, and try and disentangle what was happening, unobserved beneath the surface.It's critical that *Afterpay* protects its brand image, so I understand why *Afterpay* might prefer to talk at a high level about adverse outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is, to try and reconstruct the clearest picture possible, even though the official published information forces us to look through a glass, darkly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 10% of purchases incur a late fee[*](https://www.afterpay.com/attachment/245/show_).\n",
    "1. If you are late on one payment, there is a moderate chance that you will be late on one of the other 3[*](https://cgcooke.github.io/Blog/bayesian/pymc3/finance/monte%20carlo%20simulation/afterpay/2020/08/22/Afterpay-Customer-Defaults-Part-3.html).\n",
    "3. Late fees are 12-14 AUD on average[*](https://cgcooke.github.io/Blog/bayesian/pymc3/finance/monte%20carlo%20simulation/afterpay/2020/08/29/Afterpay-Customer-Defaults-Part-5.html#Results).\n",
    "\n",
    "All together, this is pretty interesting, and I think brings a lot of clarity to any discussion around *Afterpay* and late fees. However, what we are seeing are these numbers in isolation. We will never know what trade-offs someone may have made, to pay *Afterpay* one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a clearer picture of how late fees, I want to turn my focus to defaults. I'm interested in how often people just walk away. This is a topic where *Afterpay* has provided very little information, apart from a headline figure of losses. Hence I think any clarity would be very valuable in helping us understand *Afterpay*, and it's impact, for better or worse on society."
