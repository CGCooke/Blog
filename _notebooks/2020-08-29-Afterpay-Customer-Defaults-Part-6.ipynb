    "## Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Buy Now, Pay Later\" (BNPL) service providers like *Afterpay* have stormed onto the scene, attracting the attention of both consumers, as well as investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm intrigued by *Afterpay*. I understand that a cohort of consumers exists, who may require the cost of a purchase to be spread over 8 weeks, in order to be able to afford it. However, I fail to see the attraction for most creditworthy customers. Unless *Afterpay* dramatically starts allowing me to buy shares, I'm not really interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just because I don't see the value, doesn't mean that other people might adopt and love the product. It's clear that millions of people both in Australia, and overseas regularly use *Afterpay*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All things being equal, I can see the consumer benefits of *Afterpay*, vs other more classical forms of consumer credit (Credit cards, payday loans etc). However, *Afterpay*'s customers don't live in a vacuum, and It's entirely possible that some cohort of their customers may be using a medley of products and services to finance their lifestyle. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, all of these things exist outside the reality of what *Afterpay* reports to the ASX, and outside of my focus. I wanted to dig deeper, and try and disentangle what was happening, unobserved beneath the surface.It's critical that *Afterpay* protects its brand image, so I understand why *Afterpay* might prefer to talk at a high level about adverse outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is, to try and reconstruct the clearest picture possible, even though the official published information forces us to look through a glass, darkly.\n",
