    "Let's go on an adventure, and try and answer some questions from an incredible painting by Claude Monet called [The Cliff, Étretat, Sunset](https://learn.ncartmuseum.org/artwork/the-cliff-etretat-sunset/).\n",

    "In particular, I'm interested if we can work out:\n",

    "\n",
    "These questions are by no means new, they were addressed by [Don Olson](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/forensic-astronomer-solves-fine-arts-puzzles-116770403) and his [team](https://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2014/January-2014/Olson012114.html) from Texas State University].\n",
