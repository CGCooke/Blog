    "\n",
    "From the [previous post](https://cgcooke.github.io/Blog/bayesian/finance/2020/08/21/Afterpay-Customer-Defaults-Part-1.html), I made some high level estimates for how often *Afterpay* transactions attracted late fees. If we could better understand the real distribution of late fees, then we could in turn better estimate the frequency of late fees.\n",

    "## What do we know?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Late Fees Revenue : 46.1 million AUD\n",
    "* Average Transaction Value : Approximately 150 AUD\n",
    "   \n",
    "Furthermore, we know that the lowest and highest fee that you can be charged for a single transaction is 10 AUD and 68 AUD. Hence, this in turn bounds the average of the late fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Afterpay* is pretty transparent about their late fees, I've taken the following from [here](https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/terms-of-service#:~:text=If%20a%20payment%20is%20not,may%20be%20applied%20per%20order.).\n",

    "1. The distribution of values for transactions where customers pay late.\n",
    "2. How late they make each payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's at this stage, we have to accept that we probably can't find an exact solution, but we can settle for a good approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On assumption we could make is that the number of late payments is uncorrelated with the transaction value, and is uniformly distributed, both for delays of less than, and more than 1 week.\n",
