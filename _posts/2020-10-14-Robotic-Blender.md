Creating a Kalman Filter in 7 easy steps:
===============
One of the challenges with Kalman filters is that it's easy to be initially overwhelmed by the mathematical background, and loose sight of what their implementation looks like in practice. In reality, it's possible to break the implementation down into a series of discrete steps, which come together to fully describe the filter.


At this point, I think it's worthwhile considering how all of these matrices are related to each other.
*Tim Babb* of Bzarg, has a fantastic diagram, which sets out how information flows through all of the filters mentioned above. 
If you haven't already, I strongly recommend you read his [post](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/)  on how Kalman filters work
