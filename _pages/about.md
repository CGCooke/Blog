Hi, I'm Cameron,

I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning, Bayesian Analysis, and the future of Aerospace.

I'm writing a blog because the first step to better understanding something is to try and explain it to someone else. 

Plus I get excited about the incredible world around us, and writing helps me appreciate it all the more.

Until next time.

Cameron
