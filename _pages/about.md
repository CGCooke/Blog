Hi, I'm Cameron!

I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning, Bayesian Analysis and Flight.

I'm writing a blog because the first step to better understanding something is to try and explain it to someone else. 

Plus I get excited about the incredible world around us, and writing helps me appreciate it all the more.

I currently work with Airbus in Toulouse, France, where I get to learn from some incredible people, while helping to shape the future of the Aerospace industry.

You can read more about what I do where Airbus [here](https://www.airbus.com/careers/working-for-airbus/faces-of-airbus/meet-cameron.html).
